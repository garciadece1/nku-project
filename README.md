## DoCloud

Do you need to share documents with colleagues or friends, so that they can read them on any device? DoCloud helps you share documents without having to sign up. You can upload the documents you want, optionally provide an email address for you to manage your files later on, and you will receive a short link to share among your friends.

* 10GB Free Storage. (I'm kidding, but it will be nice)
* Documents will remain available for 24 hours.
* You can optionally sign up to manage your files and extend their life in the cloud.
